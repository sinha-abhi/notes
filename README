    Notes about things that I need for stuff I'm working on, or things that 
    I want to come back to in the future.

Compilation
===========

I use `pdflatex` to compile. For a full list of required packages, see the packages 
I use in my preamble and in the various `.tex` files.

My preamble can be found at 
<https://github.com/sinha-abhi/configuration/blob/master/preamble.tex>.

To compile (from the tex/ directory):
`pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode -output-dir=../pdf *.tex`

Topic List
==========

    - Quasi-Succinct Indexing
    - Implementing a subtype of `AbstractArray` in Julia
